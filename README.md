This repository contains a curated [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection for [Postmark's public API](https://postmarkapp.com/developer) — a fast, reliable email delivery service for transactional email.

I use this collection for testing and exploring Postmark's RESTful endpoints efficiently, without switching between docs and code.
